"Evaluates effectiveness of knowledge and skills accurately, providing examples, and providing an insightful improvement on each skill"

My Term 2 Flask app started with the best of intentions......

I've worked as a performing musician for hire since I was 17. I've done hundreds of gigs in numerous settings, but almost always playing covers for events, parties, or in pubs and clubs. 

Over time I've gone from being a "fill-in" musician working with whoever will have me to running my own bands. Working for other people allowed to see how my friends and colleagues ran their bands. I picked the best parts of what they did and iterated them into my own policies and procedures. 

Weddings are my favourite kinds of gigs to do, because you get to be a part of one of the most important days in a couple's life. There's always a crowd. There's always a vibe.  And the pay is great, but it's a very high stakes gig and I've played in some train-wrecks...(other peoples gigs. Not mine of course.....) which can be catastrophic for a wedding vendor. All it takes is one bad review to potentially sink your business. 

My goal was to create an app that would allow me to streamline the many tasks a wedding band manager/musician would likely encounter in the planning phase, thus maximising our ability to deliver a high quality performance on the day. 

All wedding gigs have essentially the same elements that fit nicely into a relational database. 
This was my initial ERD:
![ERD 1](erdA.png)
The goal was that I would be able to record all the data needed for the gig in a relational database. This included the venue, booking agent, the musicians playing, the setlist we were going to play, and the function of that setlist (cocktail hour, first dance, or party). I was going to then have a list of songs in a database that would allow us to store the information I needed for each song. This would correspond to a collection of songs I would have PDF charts for. 

All paths flowed back to the "gig" itself. By looking up a single gig entry, I could everything I needed to know about a given gig. 

One of the major problems I encountered when I actually went about building this API is that I had a mistake in the relationship between the `setlist` and `songs` tables. This is a Many-to-Many relationship which required a join table between them. 

I can now say from experience that join tables are much harder to make work than I anticipated, and were well above my skill set at the time (or even now for that matter, as I haven't revisited them!).

On review of the lecture recordings I watched to try and work out why I couldn't make the join tables work, I noticed Simon mention that he rarely, if ever had seen join tables used in a professional setting, as they introduce a level of complexity that is very difficult to troubleshoot effectively. 

With the deadline I had to meet, it was highly unlikely I was going to be able to create a functioning many-to-many join table, so I changed my design. 


......but not before trying to make a SECOND join table for the musicians....

	} 
	present() { 
		return 'I have a ' + this.carname; 
	} 
} 

class Model extends Car { 
	constructor(brand, mod) { 
		super(brand); 
		this.model = mod; 
	} 
	show() { 
		return this.present() + ', it was made in ' + this.model; 
	} 
} 

let makes = ["Ford", "Holden", "Toyota"] 
let models = Array.from(new Array(40), (x,i) => i + 1980) 

function randomIntFromInterval(min,max) { // min and max included 
	return Math.floor(Math.random()*(max-min+1)+min);
} 

for (model of models) { 

	make = makes[randomIntFromInterval(0,makes.length-1)] 
	model = models[randomIntFromInterval(0,makes.length-1)] 
	
	mycar = new Model(make, model); 
	console.log(mycar.show()) 
}
```
