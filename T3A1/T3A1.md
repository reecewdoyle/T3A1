My first command line app was the Lake Macquarie Premier League app, which was written in Python for the T1A3 assignment. 

The Lake Macquarie Premier League app is designed to be used by an administrator of an amateur Football (Soccer) competition in Lake Macquarie, NSW, Australia.

It is designed to efficiently handle data for a 14 Round season among 8 local teams. Each team plays the 7 other teams in the competition twice per year, once at their home ground, and once as the away team at their opponents home ground, for a total of 56 games, played from November 2023 to March 2024.

The goal was to make the data for the entire season easy to store, and retrieve at a moments notice, based on a few predicted user stories:

- The administrator who wants to be able to store results in a simple CSV that could then be used to feed an Excel Spreadsheet.
- The fan, who wants to how many teams are in the competition and who they are. They will also be able to look up the games occurring in the coming week, or many weeks into the future. The may also want to check games that have already happened.
- The player, who wants to be able to plan their life around the games and wants to access easily where they'll be playing for the whole season in advance, and also look back at where they played.
- Any of the above users who want to be able to view a running tally of results of the games throughout the season.

To meet all of these user stories, I decided that their would need to be 7 features in total:

1. Teams Competing
2. Games this week
3. Display Rounds
4. Display the Draw for a particular team
5. Enter Results of a game
6. Delete Results of a game
7. View the current results in a table

In order to create this app and have it look and function as it does required me to acquire skills in Python, but also in multiple Python packages. 

Analysing the code from the home screen is probably the most efficient way of getting to each of the skills required to develop this app. 

```python
from colored import fore, back, attr
from lmpl_functions import (
    print_teams, print_this_round, print_round, team_draw,
    enter_results, edit_results, view_results
)
import pyfiglet as pfg
import csv

# App Logo
text = pfg.print_figlet(text = "Lake Macquarie Premier League", font = "standard", colors = "red")

# App Greeting
print(f"{fore('red')}{back('white')} Welcome to the Lake Macquarie Premier League App for 23/24!{attr('reset')}\n")

file_name = "results.csv"

try:
    # open the file in read mode
    results = open(file_name, "r")
    results.close()
    # print("In try block")
    # if it throws an error, the file doesn't exist
    # if no error, the files exists
except FileNotFoundError:
    # Now, we know the file doesn't exist
    # Create a new file
    results = open(file_name, "w")
    results.write("Game Number,Home Team,Home Goals,Away Team,Away Goals\n")
    results.close()
    # print("In except block")

def create_menu():
    print(f"{fore('blue')} Enter 1 to view THIS YEAR'S TEAMS. {attr('reset')}")
    print(f"{fore('blue')} Enter 2 to view THIS WEEK'S GAMES. {attr('reset')}")
    print(f"{fore('blue')} Enter 3 to view a ROUND. {attr('reset')}")
    print(f"{fore('blue')} Enter 4 to view a TEAM'S DRAW. {attr('reset')}")
    print(f"{fore('blue')} Enter 5 to ENTER the RESULTS from a game.  {attr('reset')}")
    print(f"{fore('blue')} Enter 6 to REMOVE the RESULTS from a game.  {attr('reset')}")
    print(f"{fore('blue')} Enter 7 to VIEW the RESULTS.  {attr('reset')}")
    print(f"{fore('blue')} Enter 8 to exit.\n")
    choice = input(f"{fore('red')} {back('16')} Enter your selection: {attr('reset')}" "")
    return choice

users_choice = ""

while users_choice != "8":
    users_choice = create_menu()
    if (users_choice == "1"):
        print_teams()
    elif (users_choice == "2"):
        print_this_round()
    elif (users_choice == "3"):
        print_round()
    elif (users_choice == "4"):
        team_draw()
    elif (users_choice == "5"):
        enter_results(file_name)
    elif (users_choice == "6"):
        edit_results()
    elif (users_choice == "7"):
        view_results()
    elif (users_choice == "8"):
        continue
    else:
        print("Invalid Input")
```


First I had to learn how to `import` properly. 
```python
from colored import fore, back, attr
from lmpl_functions import (
    print_teams, print_this_round, print_round, team_draw,
    enter_results, edit_results, view_results
)
import pyfiglet as pfg
import csv
```

Learning to use `colored` allowed me to change the colours of the text in my app. This was especially helpful with readability. It also allowed me to make the team names reflect the team colours. 

`fore, back` allowed me to make the Greeting and the menu selections

## Question 6
***
	With reference to one of your own projects, evaluate how effective your knowledge and skills were for this project, and suggest changes or improvements for future projects of a similar nature
***

"Evaluates effectiveness of knowledge and skills accurately, providing examples, and providing an insightful improvement on each skill"

My Term 2 Flask app started with the best of intentions......

I've worked as a performing musician for hire since I was 17. I've done hundreds of gigs in numerous settings, but almost always playing covers for events, parties, or in pubs and clubs. 

Over time I've gone from being a "fill-in" musician working with whoever will have me to running my own bands. Working for other people allowed to see how my friends and colleagues ran their bands. I picked the best parts of what they did and iterated them into my own policies and procedures. 

Weddings are my favourite kinds of gigs to do, because you get to be a part of one of the most important days in a couple's life. There's always a crowd. There's always a vibe.  And the pay is great, but it's a very high stakes gig and I've played in some train-wrecks...(other peoples gigs. Not mine of course.....) which can be catastrophic for a wedding vendor. All it takes is one bad review to potentially sink your business. 

My goal was to create an app that would allow me to streamline the many tasks a wedding band manager/musician would likely encounter in the planning phase, thus maximising our ability to deliver a high quality performance on the day. 

All wedding gigs have essentially the same elements that fit nicely into a relational database. 
This was my initial ERD:
![ERD 1](erdA.png)
The goal was that I would be able to record all the data needed for the gig in a relational database. This included the venue, booking agent, the musicians playing, the setlist we were going to play, and the function of that setlist (cocktail hour, first dance, or party). I was going to then have a list of songs in a database that would allow us to store the information I needed for each song. This would correspond to a collection of songs I would have PDF charts for. 

All paths flowed back to the "gig" itself. By looking up a single gig entry, I could everything I needed to know about a given gig. 

One of the major problems I encountered when I actually went about building this API is that I had a mistake in the relationship between the `setlist` and `songs` tables. This is a Many-to-Many relationship which required a join table between them. 

I can now say from experience that join tables are much harder to make work than I anticipated, and were well above my skill set at the time (or even now for that matter, as I haven't revisited them!).

On review of the lecture recordings I watched to try and work out why I couldn't make the join tables work, I noticed Simon mention that he rarely, if ever had seen join tables used in a professional setting, as they introduce a level of complexity that is very difficult to troubleshoot effectively. 

With the deadline I had to meet, it was highly unlikely I was going to be able to create a functioning many-to-many join table, so I changed my design. 


......but not before trying to make a SECOND join table for the musicians....
![ERD B](erdB.png)
I decided that I needed this table as my first design was only going to allow me to assign a single musician to each `Gig` entry, which was not fit for purpose, as all each entry was going to have at least 2 musicians at it. My solution was to add a `Band` table. This was to account for the nature of the work. It's not uncommon for wedding bands to have a different group of musicians for any given gig. 

I attempted to get around this by changing my design again, but to no avail....
![ERD](erd.png)
This was my attempt to get around the join table between musicians and gigs, but (of course) the same problems came up again and again. 

At some point I also attempted to get around the join table for the `songs` and `setlist` table by creating 3 different tables. The problem I found here was that a `First Dance` song could be a `Cocktail Hour` etc. I had just created 3 versions of the same problem. 
![erdC](erdC.png)
Finally, I settled on a much simpler design where it was just many different One-to-Many relationships. I wasn't happy about it, but I was going to meet the deadline. 

I ended up with this:
![final erd](finalerd.png)
No more join tables. I boiled the functionality down to just a few components. Every gig still had a `First Dance Song`, a `Aisle Song` and at least one `Musician` functioning as a "Band Leader". 

In retrospect, I wish I had mastered the join table, or designed something completely different. 

I think the main skill that I lacked for this task was my ability design an app that met the criteria and matched with my skillset in Flask, PSQL and Python. The initial design was way too complex. I fundamentally didn't understand the complexities of the Many-To-Many relationship in a relational database or who to correctly implement them. I bit off FAR more than I could chew. 

To my credit, I recognised my error and course corrected. I didn't "throw good money after bad".

I think if I were doing this project again, I would design a much simpler app. I would do either just the `Musicians` or just the `Setlists` components of the apps on their own. Each of these problems would have met the scope of the requirements of the assignment. 

I think I would've favoured the `Setlist` idea, as I would be able to take advantage of using the Spotify API, which allows you to populate the table with data about each song, specifically the `Title, Artist, Key, Genre, Tempo.` You can also take advantage of existing Wedding Playlists. 

Once I had confidence in making a smaller idea work, I would've gained the knowledge, skills and confidence to expand and iterate on my initial idea by adding more features. I might have eventually gotten to a point where I was able to use the Join Tables that would've bought my initial design into reality.
