"Evaluates effectiveness of knowledge and skills accurately, providing examples, and providing an insightful improvement on each skill"

My Term 2 Flask app started with the best of intentions......

I've worked as a performing musician for hire since I was 17. I've done hundreds of gigs in numerous settings, but almost always playing covers for events, parties, or in pubs and clubs. 

Over time I've gone from being a "fill-in" musician working with whoever will have me to running my own bands. Working for other people allowed to see how my friends and colleagues ran their bands. I picked the best parts of what they did and iterated them into my own policies and procedures. 

Weddings are my favourite kinds of gigs to do, because you get to be a part of one of the most important days in a couple's life. There's always a crowd. There's always a vibe.  And the pay is great, but it's a very high stakes gig and I've played in some train-wrecks...(other peoples gigs. Not mine of course.....) which can be catastrophic for a wedding vendor. All it takes is one bad review to potentially sink your business. 

My goal was to create an app that would allow me to streamline the many tasks a wedding band manager/musician would likely encounter in the planning phase, thus maximising our ability to deliver a high quality performance on the day. 

All wedding gigs have essentially the same elements that fit nicely into a relational database. 
This was my initial ERD:
![ERD 1](erdA.png)
The goal was that I would be able to record all the data needed for the gig in a relational database. This included the venue, booking agent, the musicians playing, the setlist we were going to play, and the function of that setlist (cocktail hour, first dance, or party). I was going to then have a list of songs in a database that would allow us to store the information I needed for each song. This would correspond to a collection of songs I would have PDF charts for. 

All paths flowed back to the "gig" itself. By looking up a single gig entry, I could everything I needed to know about a given gig. 

One of the major problems I encountered when I actually went about building this API is that I had a mistake in the relationship between the `setlist` and `songs` tables. This is a Many-to-Many relationship which required a join table between them. 

I can now say from experience that join tables are much harder to make work than I anticipated, and were well above my skill set at the time (or even now for that matter, as I haven't revisited them!).

On review of the lecture recordings I watched to try and work out why I couldn't make the join tables work, I noticed Simon mention that he rarely, if ever had seen join tables used in a professional setting, as they introduce a level of complexity that is very difficult to troubleshoot effectively. 

With the deadline I had to meet, it was highly unlikely I was going to be able to create a functioning many-to-many join table, so I changed my design. 


......but not before trying to make a SECOND join table for the musicians....
![ERD B](erdB.png)
I decided that I needed this table as my first design was only going to allow me to assign a single musician to each `Gig` entry, which was not fit for purpose, as all each entry was going to have at least 2 musicians at it. My solution was to add a `Band` table. This was to account for the nature of the work. It's not uncommon for wedding bands to have a different group of musicians for any given gig. 

I attempted to get around this by changing my design again, but to no avail....
![ERD](erd.png)
This was my attempt to get around the join table between musicians and gigs, but (of course) the same problems came up again and again. 

At some point I also attempted to get around the join table for the `songs` and `setlist` table by creating 3 different tables. The problem I found here was that a `First Dance` song could be a `Cocktail Hour` etc. I had just created 3 versions of the same problem. 
![erdC](erdC.png)
Finally, I settled on a much simpler design where it was just many different One-to-Many relationships. I wasn't happy about it, but I was going to meet the deadline. 

I ended up with this:
![final erd](finalerd.png)
No more join tables. I boiled the functionality down to just a few components. Every gig still had a `First Dance Song`, a `Aisle Song` and at least one `Musician` functioning as a "Band Leader". 

In retrospect, I wish I had mastered the join table, or designed something completely different. 

I think the main skill that I lacked for this task was my ability design an app that met the criteria and matched with my skillset in Flask, PSQL and Python. The initial design was way too complex. I fundamentally didn't understand the complexities of the Many-To-Many relationship in a relational database or who to correc

I think if I were doing this project again, apart from spending time on the Join tables to make them work, I would do either just the `Musicians` or just the `Setlists` components on their own. Each of these problems would have met the scope of the requirements of the assignment. 

I think I would've favoured the `Setlist` idea, as I would be able to take advantage of using the Spotify API, which allows you to populate the table with data about each song, specifically the `Title, Artist, Key, Genre, Tempo.` You can also take advantage of existing Wedding Playlists.
